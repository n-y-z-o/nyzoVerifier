# Nyzo verifier JSON-RPC add-on

## About RPC Commands Project
This Verifier supports JSON-RPC which makes much easier for Exchanges to list Nyzo.

Reminder: Most of the rpc commands are different from other cryptocurrency.  
Exchanges may need to adjust bit to support it.

## Important note:

If you are running an exchange, block explorer, API, in order to get the blockchain to sync, please add `always_track_blockchain=1` to the `/var/lib/nyzo/production/preferences` config file.


## Guides for using RPC Server:

* [How to use the Yandev RPC server for Nyzo](https://medium.com/@nyzoco/how-to-use-the-yandev-rpc-server-for-nyzo-56e616e0e6d0)

## Testing

Exemple from bash using curl to call the "info" command:  
`curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4000/jsonrpc -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "info", "id": 1}'`

Sample censored answer:  
```
{
  "result":{
    "retention_edge":-1,
    "identifier":"0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000-0000000000000000",
    "voting_pool_size":9389,
    "trailing_edge":-1,
    "nickname":"Test",
    "block_creation_information":"0/0",
    "cycle_length":2442,
    "transaction_pool_size":0,
    "version":606010,
    "frozen_edge":10484424,
    "nyzo_string":"id__test_censored_info"
  },
