# Nyzo verifier

This is the source for the Nyzo verifier, sentinel, client, documentation server, and a few other Nyzo tools.

If you are interested in this project, we recommend visiting https://tech.nyzo.co. **This is a very different blockchain.** Please spend some time reading about the technology before diving in.

**Please note: the proof-of-diversity system requires that new verifiers be added to the cycle at a controlled rate. The length of time that a verifier must wait is related to the current cycle length and the number of verifiers waiting to join. As the cycle length increases, this may be a considerable amount of time. For instance, with a cycle length of 2000, the minimum spacing between new verifiers will be almost 8 hours.**

Step-by-step setup instructions for the verifier are available at https://tech.nyzo.co/setupInstructions/verifier.

# JSONRPC Branch

This is the JSON-RPC community version of the Nyzo Verifier.  

See https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/nyzoVerifier/blob/JSONRPC/JSONRPC_README.md for related doc and https://github.com/Open-Nyzo/nyzoVerifier/issues/5 for the Community Edition branches.
